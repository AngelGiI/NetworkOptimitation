**Network Optimization and Dynamic Strategies**

This repository contains work from my ORED course, which focused on optimization techniques in networks and dynamic problem-solving strategies. It combines algorithmic implementations and theoretical concepts in graph theory and optimization.

### Key Topics:
- **Graph Theory Basics:** Concepts such as connectivity, trees, and minimum spanning trees.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Implementations of Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms.
- **Maximum Flow Problems:** Network flow optimization using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson.
- **Advanced Topics:** Bipartite graph matching, dynamic programming in network optimization, and graph coloring.

The course included hands-on implementations in MATLAB for solving optimization problems in networks, as well as theoretical exercises.
